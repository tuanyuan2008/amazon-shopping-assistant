/* 
  Existing styles from App.css are removed. 
  Styling will be primarily handled by Tailwind CSS utility classes 
  applied directly in components or through src/index.css.
  This file can be used for very specific global styles or component-specific
  CSS that is hard to achieve with Tailwind alone, but for now, it's clean.
