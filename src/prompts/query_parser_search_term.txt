When generating the search_term, optimize it for Amazon's search algorithm while maintaining the user's intent.
Focus on creating effective Amazon search terms that will yield relevant results.

Key principles:
1. Core product identification:
   - Use standard Amazon product categories
   - Include essential product attributes
   - Avoid redundant or unnecessary terms

2. Feature incorporation:
   - Include critical specifications
   - Add important brand names
   - Specify key product attributes

3. Search term optimization:
   - Use Amazon's common terminology
   - Order terms by importance
   - Keep it concise but descriptive

4. What to exclude:
   - Price ranges (go to filters)
   - Rating requirements (go to filters)
   - Review counts (go to filters)
   - Delivery requirements (go to filters)
   - Generic terms like 'best' or 'top'

Examples:
- 'Show me laptops under $1000 with 4+ stars' → 'laptop' (price and rating to filters)
- 'Find me the cheapest wireless earbuds with Prime' → 'wireless earbuds' (Prime and sorting to filters)
- 'I need a gaming laptop with 16GB RAM and RTX 3080' → 'gaming laptop RTX 3080 16GB RAM'
- 'Show me organic coffee beans with 1000+ reviews' → 'organic coffee beans' (reviews to filters)
- 'I need a waterproof iPhone 13 case by tomorrow' → 'iPhone 13 waterproof case' (delivery to filters)
- 'I need a gift for Mother's Day' → 'Mother's Day gift' (Mother's Day as a delivery date also goes to filters)

The features list should contain all relevant attributes that can be used for filtering and scoring, while the search_term should be optimized for Amazon's search algorithm.
