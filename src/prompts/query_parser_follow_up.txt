Analyze the follow-up query in the context of previous search results. 
You can modify any aspect of the search, including:
- Adding or changing features (e.g., 'I want a black Nike backpack' after 'I want a bookbag')
- Adjusting filters (e.g., 'Show me cheaper options')
- Changing the search term (e.g., 'Actually, I want a messenger bag instead')
For example:
- If user asks 'Show me cheaper options', update price_max to the cheapest price found in the previous search
- If user asks 'Only show items with 4+ stars', update min_rating to 4
- If user asks 'I need it by tomorrow', update deliver_by to 'tomorrow'
- If user asks 'Sort by price', update sort_by to 'price-asc-rank'
- If user asks 'I want a black Nike backpack', update search_term and features
Remember: The follow-up can modify any aspect of the search, not just filters.
